```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# set root to rproj root
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```


## The Quest for the Best

Using data acquired during a night of garlic breath and shots of wine, we were tasked with finding the preferred red and white wine.

Below is a glimpse of the dataset.

```{r cars}
# read the data
wines_df  <- read_xlsx("data/garlic_games_wine_tasting.xlsx", sheet = "wine_tasting")
head(wines_df, 10)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
